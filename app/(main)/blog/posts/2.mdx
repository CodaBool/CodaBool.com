# My first Django project

Before working on this project I never really used Python. 
I can for sure say that I love it as a language after learning it. 
My favorite language now and honestly a delight to work in. 
The language is clean, powerful and popular. 
I definitely do not miss all the odd quirks of JavaScript while in Python. 

Looking back something I realized was working on Django almost set expectations wrong for me as a developer. 
The framework does so much for you out the box. 
Django combined with a Heroku deployment meant I was able to make a full scale app in minutes. 
This is why I say it set wrong expectations, everything was easy. 
I certainly still learned a lot, but the output was incredible.

This Django project was to create a blog. 
I learned Django and participated in a code along by using a Udemy course. 
Every line of code was explained to me and I was able to get a good understanding of how Django works. 
The course led us to deploy on a hosting service called PythonAnywhere. 
I did follow the course but after completion I learned Heroku and changed my deployment to there. 
The project can be viewed now under the projects tab. 
The code is also visible by visiting my Github page. 
The application lacks styling and is really a test for functionality. 
After the creation of a superuser and logging in. 
Posts can be created, comments made and approval granted. 
Posts are first stored into a draft and then can be published. 
This is all stored in a SQLite database. 
This makes things easy and removes the backend mess I would not be able to handle at the time I created this. 
There is a form of authentication needed before getting access to the stored posts. 
For creating comments there is an extra tool for highlighted text. 
Similar to the website Medium you can alter the text size, apply bold or italics by highlighting and selecting an option. 

>Python with authentication decorator for adding comments
```python
@login_required
def add_comment_to_post(request, pk):
    post = get_object_or_404(Post, pk=pk)
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = CommentForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            comment = form.save(commit=False)
            comment.post = post
            comment.save()
            return redirect('post_detail', pk=post.pk)
    else:
        form = CommentForm()
    return render(request, 'blog/comment_form.html', {'form': form})
```

I really enjoyed learning the framework and was able to successfully deploy another project under the same course. 
After making this project I began using React and learned backend with graphQL using PostgresQL. 
I learned there was training wheels put on by Django and I have since gained an appreciation for the framework. 
While today I am working to learn all the grit of setting up an enterprise level application with loose coupling of as many aspects as possible. 
I still appreciate the default bundling that Django offers. 
I would like to make another application with Django soon, to make sure I do not forget too much of the framework. 
I certainly would like to keep Django in my toolbelt and will certainly want to keep coding in Python whenever possible.
