This was a project I took up between jobs and had a lot of fun with. 
I first followed a YouTube guide from [Coding with Chaim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4V6nbP_NoQ) on how to setup a socket.io which allowed for a chat socket in React.
I then followed a YouTube guide from [NoobCoder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmrPd5ZIuo) which sets up a working Socket.io type racing game. 
I forked off from his code and used styling from [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-7eQIHRszQ).
This made for all the basic features of the app, a type race, using styling to show progress and finally a chat embedded within the same socket for the game data.

I wanted the application to have cars similar to the popular type racing game [play.typeracer.com](https://play.typeracer.com).
So, created art for different color cars and a traffic light to indicate if you were ready to start or not. 
I did try to find a way to access popular media quotes through the use of an API.
However, I could not find any which were free so I decided to solve the issue with some web scraping. 
I used chrome browser extension [Web Scraper - Free Web Scraping](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-scraper-free-web-scra/jnhgnonknehpejjnehehllkliplmbmhn) which allowed me to scrape data programmatically from pages.
I was able to find the source form which the popular typeracer.com game pulled from. 
They use user submitted quotes and they are viewable on these pages found [here](https://data.typeracer.com/pit/text_info?id=4790331).
So selecting the elements of relevant data I was able to scrape 4000 lines of JSON to use as quote data. 
This was actually ideal since it came with average word per minute speed for the given passage.
This is a bit of data I was able to use in the end of round screen. 

## Challenges
I did run into a couple issues related to building the socket. 
The biggest issue I had was with the timer for the round. 
I could not find a easy way to emit to the socket that the host should clear the timeout that the server is running. 
The only way it worked is if the creator of the socket emits to clear the timer. 
For this reason, I had to do a inefficient solution where the host will continue to run the timer when the game is over and upon a new round it will automatically be reset.
This is particularly inefficient due to the updates to game state which happen with the timer, all members of the socket are getting those new game update emits.

```js
socket.on('join-game', async ({ gameID, name }) => {

  // get game
  let game = await Game.findById(gameID)
  if (!game) {
    throw `No game found by ID ${gameID}`
  }

  // check if game is allowing users to join
  if (game.isOpen) {

    // check if player is already in game
    const playerObj = game.players.find(player => player.name === name)
    if (playerObj) {
      throw 'A player with that name already exists. Please change your name and try again or create a new game.'
    }

    // make players socket join the game room
    socket.join(gameID)

    // create our player
    let player = {
      socketID: socket.id,
      name
    }

    // add player to the game
    game.players.push(player)

    // save the game
    game = await game.save()

    // send updated game to all sockets within game
    io.to(gameID).emit('updateGame', game)
  } else {
    throw 'Game Closed'
  }
})
```

Another issue I ran into which was kind of hilarious was that if you refreshed the page you could join the game repeatedly.
This was due to the join logic happening by the content of the URL query. 
Meaning if you join a game you will be pushed to the route of /online?gameID=GAME_ID and refreshing will attempt the same join game logic.
This is fine but there needed to be validation on if the player was already in the game. 
I did not have accounts or want to add authentication to the app. 
However, what I did have was a requirement for entering a username. 
I used this to validate. Usernames need to be unique to join the game.
This is not fool proof but should work fine for the scope of this game. 

## What I learned
I learned a lot, too many things to write out here but a neat thing which I learned was how to automatically delete data on the database.
Every time a game was created it would be stored and this can quickly lead to a overfilled database with no reason for keeping most of its collections.
So, there is a feature in mongoose (NPM MongoDB driver wrapper) where you can have documents delete after a select time.

```js
createdAt: {
  type: Date,
  default: Date.now,
  index: { expires: '45m' }
}
```

&emsp;
I also learned from some StackOverflow comments that Math.random is not a great source of randomness and the crypto library is much more secure.
I used the built in js/node crypto module to generate the game ids. 

```js
const crypto = require('crypto')

game._id = crypto.randomBytes(3).toString('hex').toUpperCase()
```


### Future updates to this app
&emsp;
I may want to update this app later, we will see.
If I were too, I would like to add:
- car customization
- account creation
- leaderboard
- convert mp4 title into a pure js/css/html bundle in case moving off Heroku hosting and data expenses become a problem
