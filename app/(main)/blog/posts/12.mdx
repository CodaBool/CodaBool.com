# Senior Project, Social media for stopping human trafficking
> A sample of this project which can be seen [here](https://codabool.com/projects#6)

&emsp;
For my senior project I worked with a team of 8 peers to build a social media site.
The purpose of the site is to assist in finding and getting help to those affected by human trafficking.
We were able to work with law enforcement to get insight into the problems that face those affect by this issue.
They were able to inform us that most exchanges happen online and through advertisements.
We also had an interview with someone whose senior project was to scrape (extract information) from Twitter posts for possible human trafficking advertisements.
Scraping is difficult due to the friction with social media sites as well as being inherently prone to breaking due to having a constant need for updating.
Also social media sites will often detect and limit automated activity.
We decided to build a social media site since it would use relevant technologies and be more maintainable than scraping.

&emsp;
We split the team into front end and back end development.
We did weekly meetings to set priorities and expectations.
The technology stack was React front end, Express back end.
The images for posts would be uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket (cloud storage).
We stored the rest of our data into MongoDB.
I rebuilt this application into a Nextjs application just for my own hosting.

&emsp;
I was able to learn a lot of different things for this application.
I made two major decisions for the application and they worked out well.
I chose against the popular choice for both solutions.
The choices were in forms and global state.
At the time of writing the popular solution for forms is to use formik (form) and yup (validation).
The popular choice for global state is Redux.
Both of these are the popularity winners for their purpose at the time of writing.

## Redux vs Context
&emsp;
We knew authentication was needed and for that a global state is necessary.
I was the only one with experience with Redux and React Context so I was tasked to chose the path here.
While at the time of writing Redux is a major player in global context I decided against using it.
I chose to use React Context because of the large overhead which Redux adds.
The use of reducers and actions adds many new lines of code to an application and is not intuitive.
Context is much more intuitive from a component perspective like React.
While there are hooks provided like useReducer to perform complex state management we kept it simple and just used basic useContext.
I also like to restrain from large packages if possible and take the simplest path.
This makes the project more maintainable and more often than not is the more time efficient method.

## formik + yup vs React Hook Form
The other major decision was in forms and validation.
At the time of writing Formik and Yup are the popular solution in React.
However, I read an article which went into depth about the performance compared to React Hook Form.
I found the results fairly convincing.
React Hook Form is 4kB smaller with no dependencies and 270ms faster than Formik.
Formik has 7 dependencies [see bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=formik).

Choosing against the popular choice can be disastrous.
There is always a horrible moment as a developer when you realize there is no documentation or guide for something you need and you will need to walk on ground where no one has left guiding signs.
Luckily I was not too far off any path and was able to find helpful guides for both state and forms.
I did hit snags with both solutions but nothing which I would not have ran into if I picked differently.

## Creating a Great Form.
> Code for the signup page [github](https://github.com/CodaBool/p06-social/blob/main/pages/signup.js)

Forms are a frustrating part of websites.

>> Why is it not working?

>> I've tried that already!

>> I can't remember my password!

Users should be informed why something is not working and be given hints as to what is needed.
To reduce friction proper form validation is needed.

> React Hook Form combined with Bootstrap Form.Control
```js
<Controller
  as={<Form.Control />}
  control={control}
  type="email"
  name="email"
  defaultValue=""
  placeholder="name@example.com"
  required
  rules={{
    validate: () => {
      if (!/^(("[\w-\s]+")|([\w-]+(?:\.[\w-]+)*)|("[\w-\s]+")([\w-]+(?:\.[\w-]+)*))(@((?:[\w-]+\.)*\w[\w-]{0,66})\.([a-z]{2,6}(?:\.[a-z]{2})?)$)|(@\[?((25[0-5]\.|2[0-4][0-9]\.|1[0-9]{2}\.|[0-9]{1,2}\.))((25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|[0-9]{1,2})\.){2}(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|1[0-9]{2}|[0-9]{1,2})\]?$)/.test(getValues("email"))) return false
    }
  }}
/>
```

This uses a hilariously large regex I found on StackOverflow, difficult to read (might as well be binary to me) but after some testing it has proven itself.
Searching again now, I only find shorter regex so, I am not entirely sure where I even found this regex from.

But besides the rules property this is how React Hook Form works.
While different from the regular use case as it uses a Controller to allow Bootstrap Component to pass as a child.
You connect the control and fill the required properties of name and defaultValue.

I did run into issues on trying to combine the styling of Bootstrap's Form.Control with React Hook Form.
However, going through their documentation I was able to find the Controller which allows an as property which you can pass a component and all properties will get passed on to it.
This was a great compatibility feature of React Hook Form and allowed for quick styling while getting great validation control.

I added a package for displaying the strength of the current password.
There is validation which informs the user if their passwords do not match or do not meet requirements if submitted and failed.

I was able to work on the backend for it's authentication as well.
Our application stores the session client side in the form of json web tokens.
These are stored in http only cookies.

> Passing around cookies and milk from server-side to client-side
```js
try {
  const email = clientData.email
  // use preferred db to select user data
  const user = await getUser(email)
  // use bcrypt compare to compare the plain text password to the db stored hash
  const validPassword = await compare(clientData.password, user.password)
  if (validPassword) {
    // create a json web token which stores the email and is signed with a secret
    const token = jwt.sign({ email }, process.env.JWT_SECRET)
    // add as a response cookie, using httpOnly for security
    // best to also security and sameSite properties here too
    res.cookie('jwt', token, {
      expires: new Date(Date.now() + 3600000),
      httpOnly: true,
    })
    res.status(200).json({ token, email })
  } else {
    res.status(400).send('Invalid Password')
  }
} catch (err) {
  res.status(400).send('Server error, Could not verify user')
}
```

This code runs every time the user logs in and will store a session cookie which can only be read from the server.
Our database was MongoDB and the `getUser` function makes a call to it to get the hashed user object with the needed password.
Bcrypt is used for comparing those passwords with its `compare` function.
Many tutorials use localstorage for their jwt (json web token) storage but I find the httpOnly cookies to be the most secure option.
I do find localstorage quick and easy for configuration settings for the user.

There is a lot more to this application and it was a great experience working on it.
I was glad to work on so many new technologies like using AWS S3 for image storage and the experience I was able to get from working both ends of the tech. stack.
I hope I can use this knowledge for any future social media type applications I built in the future
