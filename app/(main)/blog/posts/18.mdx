# Charts can be fun
>> A live sample can be see [here](https://codabool.com/projects#10)

I have run into many instances where a company has setup their organization the way they want and have monitoring data but no great way to view it.
This is where I found out about [Chart.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chart.js) a very popular way of displaying charts with a canvas.
But if you are using React like I was, you want its companion [react-chartjs-2](npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2).
This is surprisingly simple to create wonderful graphs which are animated and interactive.
You just create a data object and pass it as props.

```jsx
// set the data for the doughnut chart
const data = {

  // labels will be the legend for the sections
  labels: ['water', 'electricity', 'internet'],

  // dataset defines what how large and the color of each section
  datasets: [
    {
      data: [100, 200, 80],
      backgroundColor: ['red', 'green', 'blue'],
    }
  ]
}

// render
return <Doughnut data={data} />
```

This creates a red, green and blue doughnut chart with the amount for each section matching the values in the data array.
Here is an example of what another doughnut chart looks like after rendering to the package

### Authentication
I also wanted this to be a secure application since I planned to self-host it and fill it with private keeping.
So, to secure the application I went with a natural fit for authentication in Next.js which is [next-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-auth).
This allows me to signup and login to my application. I restrict the signup to only a small list of emails I know I can trust.
After filling up the signup emails, I then have a couple secure accounts which have exclusive access to the application.

### Database
I used MongoDB for my database solution.
Nothing too complex was happening with the data entry side, just simple CRUD operations for the records.
However, I did have a complex situation with retrieving the data. I wanted all the chart data to be returned from one complex MongoDB query if possible.
Turns out you can use a statement aggregator to accomplish this.
This ended up being very verbose but gets me the data exactly how I want it for the bar graph, doughnut graph and history table all in one query.


> A GET request for all the app data using a MongoDB aggregator

```js
// the middleware will ensure a mongo connection is established
export default applyMiddleware(async (req, res) => {
  try {

    // deconstruct the request into the needed values
    const { method, body, query } = req

    // next-auth function to authorize from the req jwt
    const session = await getSession({ req })
    if (!session) throw 'Unauthorized'

    // mongodb model query to get the matching db user with the one found in the jwt
    const user = await User.findOne({ email: session.user.email.toLowerCase() })

    // only allow users which are signed up
    if (!user) throw `Could Not find ${session.user.email}`

    // get the data, I would show the aggregated statement but its about 80 lines long
    const agg = await getAgg()
      .catch(err => {throw err})

    // return the result
    res.status(200).json(agg[0])
  } catch (err) {

    // ===================================== handle errors =====================================
    // I use a trick here to seperate out runtime errors versus errors I have written throws for
    // this works due to the way that explicitly throwing an error the way I do returns a String

    if (typeof err === 'string') {

      // my thrown error
      res.status(400).json({  err })
    } else {

      // something unexpected
      res.status(500).json({ msg: (err.message || err)})
    }
  }
})
```
### Records
I used Bootstrap styling to make a table for the record keeping
Using Next.js api I developed the backend so that I could add new records using the bottom row form

> Table of records
<Img src="/posts/18/table.jpg" size="lg" float />

## Future
I still am actively using this application.
I do notice a bug that the total is running up the table.
When the intended behavior is that the Total column would be in reverse from what is seen in the screenshot above.
I built out a CI/CD with Github Actions which will ssh and restart my systemctl for the node application.
So, really this is in a state where I can just add whatever front-end features I would like.
Then if I need to Next.js makes it easy to add any additional backend code with their amazing opinionated api folder tooling.

### Possible features
- sort by labels
- budget page
- edit date or rather be able to pick date instead of assuming 'today'
- another graph to see how much is left for something
