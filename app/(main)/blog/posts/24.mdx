# Managing Obesity
> This is a live project which can be seen at the home page [here](https://p10.codabool.com)

US obesity prevalence was 42% in 2017 - 2018 ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html)).
This app seeks to provide a tool to manage obesity.
This was done for a school project, I worked as a solo team on this application.

## The Project
This app uses Next.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and next-auth for authentication. 
I also use a nice npm package called chart.js to make pretty charts 😎.
There is also some Three.js which I was happy to include.

I had a lot of fun using Three.js it was used to make for some fun buttons for which to navigate with.
As you can see on the performance page there are 3 categories by which to track progress.
There is Diet, Exercise and Weight. These are all models I was able to use from SketchFab.
They were under a creative commons license and I provided all the necessary credit to use them.
I did do some small alterations to have the Diet model fit better.
I also cut down on the polygons for the Weight model.
I was surprised to see how small some models could be. The bike model for example is just 10KB in size.
This makes for an efficient page which can easily download all the data quickly and make for a better user experience.

There was a requirement to use some form of health data for the application.
I chose to use a BMI dataset collected by the CDC.
This BMI data is then used for a histogram which places the users own data on top of.
Thi can be seen with the small blue dot on the chart below at the 46 mark.
The dataset can be found in CDCs [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) page](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Examination&Cycle=2017-2020) under the "Body Measures" Data file. 
This uses an XPT file format, which may require downloading software. For this the software "Datasly" can be used. 
The column Body Mass Index (BMXBMI) was used, filtering out empty values and rows which contained any value for BMI Category - Children/Youth (BMDBMIC).
Filtering out rows which contain BMDBMIC effectively removes all data collected from youth ages 1-18. 
This leaves 8388 usable rows of adult data which was then processed to generate a BMI histogram viewable within the application.

# Vanilla still works
There was an interesting problem of how to make multiple lines in a table editable.
I was able to accomplish this with the use of some vanilla JS.
This is why you should always learn some JS before React.
There are just always going to be times when the simplest approach is the one outside of the library.


## The problem
I wanted to have a table which could change from showing data to have editable data.
This proved difficult since it would require juggling a lot of input elements.
Also they are being added and removed from the page so its easy to lose track of the reference and the data.

```js
<Button variant="light" className="darken-on-hover mb-3 ms-5" style={{width: '220px'}} onClick={() => alert("Edit Mode Toggled")}><PencilFill className="ml-2 mb-1" size={14} /> Edit</Button>
<Table striped bordered hover className="mx-auto ms-5">
  <thead className="w-100">
    <tr>
      <th>Date</th>
      <th>Weight</th>
      <th>Unit</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>{new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US').format(new Date() - (86400000 * 1))}</td>
      <td>220</td>
      <td>lb</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>{new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US').format(new Date() - (86400000 * 2))}</td>
      <td>218</td>
      <td>lb</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>{new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US').format(new Date() - (86400000 * 3))}</td>
      <td>216</td>
      <td>lb</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>{new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US').format(new Date() - (86400000 * 4))}</td>
      <td>214</td>
      <td>lb</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>{new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US').format(new Date() - (86400000 * 5))}</td>
      <td>212</td>
      <td>lb</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

<br />
{/* <Button variant="outline-success" className="darken-on-hover my-5 ms-5" style={{width: '220px'}} onClick={() => alert("Save + End edit mode")}><PencilFill className="ml-2 mb-1" size={14} /> Save</Button> */}

          <option value="lb">lb</option>
          <option value="kg">kg</option>
        </Form.Select>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <input value={new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US').format(new Date() - (86400000 * 4))} />
      </td>
      <td><input type="number" defaultValue="214" /></td>
      <td>
        <Form.Select>
          <option value="lb">lb</option>

          <option value="lb">lb</option>
          <option value="kg">kg</option>
        </Form.Select>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>
```

What I ended up doing was using some simple vanilla JS with the use of querySelector, getElementsByTagName and node iteration.
I first assigned an id to every input when it is added to the page. This is done in a map in the render method (in the return since it is a functional component). 
Then this makes setting the appropriate value to each input easy I have a useEffect hook which sets the initial value of all inputs on the table.
This allows me to not need to mess with state for all the inputs, which would get messy. 
I instead am just providing the initial value and then later extracting all final values.
Whatever the user does to the input along the way I don't track here.

> Set the value into the revealed input rows
```js
const [edit, setEdit] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  if (edit) {
    data.forEach(row => {
      const weightInput = document.querySelector(`#in-weight-${row.id}`)
      const unitInput = document.querySelector(`#in-unit-${row.id}`)
      weightInput.value = row.weight
      unitInput.value = row.unit
    })
  }
}, [edit])
```

After the initial values have been set for all rows of input on the table. I will then only save the data once the user is done.
Once the save button has been clicked. I begin on extracting the data from all the inputs in the table.
I first use getElementsByTagName to get all row nodes.
I then iterate with a for loop creating a temporary data object which will be send to the backend in an array of data objects.
I search through the nodes by looking at their children and then their id which was assigned in the useEffect written above.
Once I see an id that I recognize or alternatively a tagName of 'INPUT' / 'SELECT' I know I which of the three inputs I have found.
I then extract the value of the element and push that with the id up to begin another loop over the table rows.

> Posting the data from a table that has been edited
```js
function save() {
  const tr = document.getElementsByTagName('tr')
  const arr = []
  for (const row of tr) {
    let obj = {data: {}, id: ''}
    for (const col of row.childNodes) {
      if (col.childNodes[0].id) {
        if (col.childNodes[0].id.includes('in-date')) { // date
          obj.data.measuredAt = col.childNodes[0].value
        }
      }
      if (col.childNodes[0].tagName === 'INPUT') { // weight
        const fullId = col.childNodes[0].id
        obj.id = fullId.split('-')[2]
        obj.data.weight = col.childNodes[0].value
      }
      if (col.childNodes[0].tagName === 'SELECT') { // unit
        if (col.childNodes[0].childNodes[1]) {
          obj.data.unit = col.childNodes[0].value
        }
      }
    }
    if (obj.id) arr.push(obj)
  }
  axios.put('/api/weight', arr)
    .then(res => {
      setEdit(false)
      mutate()
    })
    .catch(console.log)
}
```

Once the data is posted I will have several promises to request to the database. 
For that I use a for loop where I go over the data in the body of the request.
I have an array of promises I am building which are requests to Prisma to update the data by the id.
I already have the data formatted the way Prisma wants so all that is needed is some small validation on the date as well as number properties in the data.
```js
const promises = []
for (const weight of body) {
  // validate
  if (weight.data.unit !== 'lb' && weight.data.unit !== 'kg') {
    throw 'A unit other than lb or kg was found'
  }
  if (isNaN(Number(weight.data.weight))) {
    throw 'Cannot cast a weight to Number'
  }
  // change from date String back to date obj
  weight.data.measuredAt = new Date(weight.data.measuredAt)
  weight.data.weight = Number(weight.data.weight)

  promises.push(prisma.weight.update({
    where: { id: weight.id }, data: weight.data
  }))
}
await Promise.all(promises)
```

This will wait for all the requests to finish and have an updated database.
Once the request is done it will return and the start a mutate call which means new data should be fetched.
This completes the cycle and data has successfully been edited by the user.

This is something which you can try out by going [here](https://p10.codabool.com/track/weight) and clicking the edit button.
