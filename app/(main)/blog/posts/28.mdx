# Slap card game

I have brought my favorite card game into the browser.
You can play with up to three friends in one game.
The game is not polished in anyway so forgive the flaws in presentation and experience.
There is no available tutorial or instructions on how to play which makes it confusing at the moment.

### The Development
I wrote this in Three.js which uses the OpenGL library to render 3D scenes in the browser.
I used React so that I could easily reuse components.
The backend requires a websocket server which connects players in a lobby.
The events are broadcasted from the server to other players in the same lobby.
In this way you get live movement and actions from other players in game.

I did write the server in Golang but ran into bugs.
The support for socket.io is far behind in version.
It seems most people that do websockets in Go just write without the socket.io wrapper.
However, you lose some nice features such as auto-reconnections, broadcasting, and packet buffering.
So, I ultimately switched back to a node socket.io server.

### Using a single Texture
Threejs does not have great support for using texture atlas.
This is very useful in game development because you can load one image and section it for use with multiple objects.
I have a single image with all card faces and use the code below to


```js
export class TextureAtlas {
  constructor(json, texture) {
    this.textures = {};

    const { frames } = json;

    Object.keys(frames).forEach((name) => {
      const t = texture.clone();
      const data = frames[name].frame;
      t.repeat.set(data.w / texture.image.width, data.h / texture.image.height);
      t.offset.x = data.x / texture.image.width;
      t.offset.y =
        1 - data.h / texture.image.height - data.y / texture.image.height;
      t.needsUpdate = true;
      t.name = name

      this.textures[name] = t;
    });
  }

  getTexture(name) {
    return this.textures[name];
  }
}
```

This will take a manifest object and the original texture atlas sheet.
The output will be a the main texture but with a sepecific offset applied.
This will effectively produce 52 unique textures from a single image.
A section of the manifest object can be seen here:

```js
const manifest = {
  "meta": {
    "image": "cards-1200-w.png",
    "size": { "w": 1200, "h": 527 },
    "scale": "1"
  },
  "frames": {
    "ace_of_diamonds": { "frame": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 92, "h": 132 } },
    "ace_of_hearts": { "frame": { "x": 0, "y": 132, "w": 92, "h": 132 } },
    ...
```

This manifest object will have the name of the card as well as it's pixel location on the atlas sheet.
I was really happy to get a solution for this working.
This reduced the texture requests send from 52 to just one.
This also is a great game performance optimization since loading in textures can be costly.

Originally I tried to use the threejs method of using SVGs since normally those would be extremely smaller than image textures.
However, the performance was horrible for whatever reason.
So, that approach was abandonded.


#### Characters
Another difficulty was in having 4 different characters with animations.
I had to use the `three-stdlib` package for cloning skeletons from an original character.

`const scene = useMemo(() => SkeletonUtils.clone(object), [object])`

Which can successfully create four characters.
However, there is added difficulty in that I needed a map of the characters to interpret incoming peer multiplayer clients.
This lead to a long file with plenty of conditionals which find the correct model in everyone's client and animate, position, rotate to the correct spot.

Physics was surprisingly simple.
I used the Rust based `Rapier` package which has plenty of great features.
Would definitely recommend them over the popular cannonjs physics library.

# Final Thoughts
Overal the project was a huge learning experience.
This definitely makes any future 3D web dev multiplayer projects way easier in the future.
