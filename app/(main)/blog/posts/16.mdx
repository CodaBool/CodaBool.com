# My First full time Tech job
Last last position was as an intern.
This will be my first salary job that I've ever had.
I had to go through a couple interview stages to get the position landed but everything went smoothly.

I fill quite a few roles. I am tasked to onboard new developers as well understand the devops tasks used in my team.
I am glad that Leidos has given me this chance to prove I belong in the tech industry.

When onboarding developers I introduce them to React and Redux.
The course takes a full week for each section and then moves on to the next.
I also learned .NET for the first time.
While I never led the course I had to become knowledgeable enough to help developers get through a training course and answer questions.
I taught Spring Java, as well as created my own Docker course for new developers to take.
There is also a lesson with Rabbitmq, a message queuing protocol.
I also taught developers how to use OpenAPI or Swagger to make automatic API docs.
