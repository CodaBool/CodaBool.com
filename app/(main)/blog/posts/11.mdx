# Production Dashboard
> A sample of this project which can be seen [here](https://codabool.com/projects#4)

Starting this job around when COVID hit was difficult.
I was used to walking over to someone's desk when I needed help.
Now if I needed help, I sent out a message on our Slack app.
Responses were delayed and it was difficult to know if you were going to get the help you need.
I chose to join a team which was dissolved within a few weeks.
This was due to a lack of response from the project lead.
I was fortunate in that I started early in looking at joining another project.

I joined a team of two, one of which I still work with now three months later.
Our project was to create a dashboard which could display the status of several deployments.
Ellucian offers tech solutions to many clients which in total serve millions of students.
The dashboard was an easy way to see what was built and how long ago.
The raw output data which supplies the table with information is from Jenkins.
The console output is parsed by a Powershell script written by someone on my team.
This is then served through a Node Express server which is then available to be called to by our React app.

There are many options when it comes to making a table in React.
We even tried out a few different options.
Eventually we landed on making the app using AG-Grid which has great features.
The interface is simple, and there are a vast array of options on how to control the table.
We made use of a lot of the features including custom tooltips, custom css, fast reloading.
This all enabled the table to be quick and information.

A great feature of the table is that it has different customizable aspects.
You can filter search each column, change size, alter the refresh rate for the data.
We wanted a table which remembered these settings. We added support for creating and reading cookies.
This allows the page to be refreshed and the columns will be filtered by the same data.

One tricky part of the project was having multiple tables, or what is perceived as multiple tables.
Basically there are different production environments that need to be switched between.
The most logical way to separate out these views is with a tabulated table which changes the view.
At first we setup a different initialization of ag-grid on each route.
However, this lead to issues with state crossing over into other tables.
This happened due to the fact that every row and column needs its own unique ID to be managed.
When you have hundreds of total rows and columns, some with the same name but in a different category this can be tricky.
We in the end make one initialization of the ag-grid and were able to pass it dynamically the data for each tab and refresh the table.

Our application was complete and we needed to deploy on a Windows machine.
This was difficult since many server tools are built in Linux and are simpler to handle.
After correctly configuring a proxy for the express and setting up a domain for the application to be under we were done.
The project is used in production currently and the project manager was very satisfied with our work.
I was expecting us to be called back to fix something breaking on it sometime soon after finishing it.
However, I never heard back a complaint and since have got back in touch with the manager and she told me the app runs smoothly without any issue.

While I cannot recreate a good clone of the project for public viewing since it depends on many other server components.
I did manage to strip away a couple features to allow it to work with a static data set for viewing.
