# 🏴‍☠️ Tampa Devs
> A live version of the site can be seen [here](https://p15.codabool.com)

Vincent allowed me to write the landing page for the upcoming hack-a-thon in the Tampa area.
His organization TampaDevs is hosting it and a page is needed to get out information on the event.

### Theatre
I used a package called theatre which allowed me to create the fly through effect. 
I mainly followed the guide found [here](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2023/02/14/animate-a-camera-fly-through-on-scroll-using-theatre-js-and-react-three-fiber/) to get that to work.

Take a look at the event page and let me know if you experience any issues.
Easiest way is you can comment at the bottom of this blog post.
