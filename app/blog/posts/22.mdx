# üè´ Back to school

I have been admitted to Georgia Tech Online. I was first introduced to it by my brother who is currently attending.
He is soon to graduate and recommended the school. 
My new job at Oddball allows me to spend towards education and have the cost covered. 
So, I am using this opportunity to further my education.

I am going for a Masters in Computer Science.
There were a couple specialization paths which I could do.
I ended up picking the [Interactive Intelligence](https://omscs.gatech.edu/specialization-interactive-intelligence)
which has a focus on AI.

I have already signed up for my first class, [Intro to Health Informatics](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6440-intro-health-informatics). 
Which is such a cool timing since I am working for the largest health care provider in the country. 

I think there will be a lot I can learn from attending.
I will be keeping the work load light from it by signing up for only 1 class a semester. 
Which would put me to graduate in about two and a half years.

## First semester Update

I have completed Intro to Health Informatics. I finished the course with an A. I enjoyed learning about the medical industry and where it is going in terms of technology. I will not be forgetting what I learned in this class. I consider it a valuable experience for any industry where the work is so important that lives are at risk if the technology fails. I believe this to be a great responsibility and can make you think about how important lines of text on a file can really be.
