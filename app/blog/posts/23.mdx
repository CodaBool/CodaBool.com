## What was talked about

I spoke about what DevOps is and the basics of getting started.
The slides for this presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rpbtEQIdGf7nMPmT6wnt9egBcMDMsdgpAC4D4EvNGfs/edit?usp=sharing).
I mainly covered Terraform, Bash and Github Actions. 
A resource that is helpful for those new to DevOps is a [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops).

## TampaDevs

I have not given any technical talks like this before and I did find that I over prepared for the event.
I had about double the amount of material than what I had time for. 
Thankfully the event ended right on the final deploy of my first of two demos I set for the night.
This was done by creating a Terraform pipeline on Github Actions which would deploy a EC2 instance.

> Terraform

```js
resource "aws_instance" "al2" {
  ami           = var.al2_ami
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = aws_key_pair.pub_key.key_name
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.tampadev.id]
  tags = {
    Name = "al2"
  }
}
```

This Terraform was ran by Github Actions which was simply running a `terraform apply` command

> Github Actions
```yml
- name: Run Terraform
  working-directory: ./terraform
  run: |
    terraform init
    terraform apply -auto-approve
```

However, this is just a bare Amazon Linux 2 AMI with nothing on it. 
For the demo I wanted to show something so I have a [repository](https://github.com/CodaBool/tampa-dev) with a small Three.js application.
So, I would install git, node and nginx to download and serve the application.
I used a Github Actions Marketplace action called appleboy/ssh-action. 
If I were to redo this demo I would replace this with a more reputable configuration tool like Ansible.
The bash script ran can be seen here to startup a web server of the application.

> Configuration Bash script
```bash
curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -
sudo yum install nodejs -y
sudo yum install git -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
git clone https://github.com/CodaBool/tampa-dev.git
cd tampa-dev
npm ci
npm run build
sudo cp -TR build /usr/share/nginx/html
```

That completed the first demo and I had ran out of time.
I prepared a much more advanced demo which involved Docker and a scalable usage with Fargate however, it would have ran over the event time.

## Looking back

I had a lot of fun after the event talking with people.
I got to talk about Git for a good amount of time with someone and actually enjoyed it.
They had given a talk on the tool and had lots of knowledge on Git.
It was fun to be around developers who know their stuff.
I like to be in a room with a ton of smart people.
It helps me learn and also the environment there was uplifting.

So many of the people I talked to just love to learn things.
Which is exactly how I would describe myself.
So, finding people just like myself was absolutely a highlight of the visit to Tampa for this talk.

## The Community

I got to also spend time with Vincent.
His TampaDevs community has grown extremely fast and it is all thanks to his effort into the community.
He is such a likeable guy and I would be happy to help out at any of his future events.
I already asked him to give another talk on Docker.
So, maybe by the end of this year I will be in Tampa again to do another event.
