# New job at Oddball

I have just been hired at the company Oddball, their website can be seen at [oddball.io](https://oddball.io).
I have been hired on as the role of a DevOps Engineer.

The company of Oddball does sub contracting to a government contractor which maintains CMS online infrastructure. CMS is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which is the largest medical provider in the United States. 
What appealed to me for this position was that it was using AWS and was DevOps. My last job at Leidos functioned as a teacher role much of the time and I wanted to do more DevOps related tasks. Leidos also was transitioning over to Atlassian Bamboo for their CI/CD and used Azure for their infrastructure or in house servers. I wanted to work with the most popular industry tools and standards. So, this switch seemed like a good fit for me. 
I do see that I can get an education stipend so I also am now looking to see what education goals I could make.

## 5 month update

I have been really enjoying this position and company. I have been learning so much about DevOps as well as the AWS platform. The company is making a switch over to Fargate. Which is a managed Docker container deployment service in AWS. This means I can get more Docker experience which I always value. 

## 8 month update

Oddball has been great for my understanding of DevOps. While I originally thought of many of the solutions which the teams worked on as more simple than previous positions I've had. I have come to see some of the complexities which affect the daily workflow of the teams. There are many standards to comply with as well as large changes which are being made in parallel.
